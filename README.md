# About Project:
The goal of this project is to detect Faces and Eyes in the images and from webcam. I have used Haar feature-based cascade classifiers 
which is one of the effective methods of object detection as proposed by Paul Viola and Michael Jones.

The project contains four python files:

  1. face_detection_image.py 
      
      This file is used to only detect the face of a person from specified image. I had used Elon Musk image if you wants to use another
      image then, make changes at line number 5 in code in place of "elon.jpg" use your image name but, make sure that the image should be 
      at same location where the code is saved.
       
  2. face_detection_camera.py
  
      This file is used to only detect the face of a person from webcam. This code is written for thos who are using inbuilt webcam for
      those how are using external webcam make some changes in code as the line number 4 is "cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0)" make it as
      cap = cv2.VideoCapture(1) i.e. in place of 0 write 1.
      
  3. face_eye_detection_image.py
  
      This file is used to detect the face and eyes of a person from specified image. I had used Elon Musk image if you wants to use another
      image then, make changes at line number 7 in code in place of "elon.jpg" use your image name but, make sure that the image should be 
      at same location where the code is saved.
      
  4. face_eye_detection_camera.py
  
      This file is used to detect the face and eyes of a person from webcam. This code is written for thos who are using inbuilt webcam for
      those how are using external webcam make some changes in code as the line number 5 is "cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0)" make it as
